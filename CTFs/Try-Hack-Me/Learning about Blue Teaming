Lab Report: Web Reconnaissance & Defensive Controls

Path: Security Operations (SOC) Focus: Incident Investigation & Endpoint Hardening

1. Objective

The goal of this lab was to transition from theoretical knowledge of SOC roles to the practical investigation of unauthorized web discovery. I performed an analysis of an active directory enumeration attack and implemented defensive measures to mitigate automated reconnaissance.


2. Cybersecurity Roles & Responsibilities

During this lab, I explored the distinct functions of the security team and how they collaborate during an investigation:

    SOC Analyst: Responsible for continuous monitoring of security consoles and initial triage of alerts to identify potential threats.

    Threat Hunter: Proactively searches through networks and datasets to detect hidden malicious activity that has evaded existing security controls.

    Incident Responder: Acts as the first line of defense during a confirmed breach, focusing on containment, eradication, and recovery.

    Digital Forensics: Conducts deep-dive investigations into digital evidence to determine the root cause, timeline, and extent of a security incident.


3. Technical Investigation: Web Discovery & Enumeration

I conducted a forensic analysis of a "Web Discovery" attack, where an external actor attempted to map the hidden structure of a web application.

    Mechanics: The attacker utilized Directory Enumeration to brute-force hidden paths.

    Observation: I analyzed server responses to identify automated requests targeting common directories like /admin, /config, and /backup.

    Identification: By auditing the HTTP status codes in the logs, I identified the difference between unsuccessful attempts (404 Not Found) and successful discoveries (200 OK).


4. Defensive Implementation: Rate Limiting & WAF

To counter the "noisy" nature of directory enumeration, I explored two primary defensive layers:
Rate Limiting

    Implementation: Configured thresholds to limit the number of requests a single source can send within a specific window (e.g., 60 requests per minute).

    Result: This creates a "workable solution" that makes high-speed automated brute-forcing technically impossible without triggering a 429 (Too Many Requests) block.

Web Application Firewall (WAF)

    Function: Learned the role of a WAF in inspecting incoming HTTP traffic for malicious patterns.

    Application: A WAF can be tuned to detect the specific signatures of common enumeration tools (like Gobuster or Dirbuster), dropping the traffic before it reaches the web server.


5. Summary of Findings

    Attack Vector: Automated Directory Brute-forcing.

    Indicator of Compromise (IoC): High-frequency 404 errors followed by a successful 200 OK on a sensitive directory.

    Mitigation Strategy: Implementation of strict Rate Limiting and WAF filtering rules.
